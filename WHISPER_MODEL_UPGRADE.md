# Whisper Model Upgrade for Better Transcription Quality

## Current vs Recommended Models

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Use Case |
|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **base.en** (current) | 39MB | Fast | Good | Development/Testing |
| **medium.en** (recommended) | 769MB | Medium | Better | Production meetings |
| **large-v3** (best) | 1550MB | Slower | Best | Critical meetings |

## Applied Change

Updated default model from `base.en` to `medium.en`:
```python
self.whisper_model_path = os.getenv('WHISPER_MODEL_PATH', './whisper.cpp/models/ggml-medium.en.bin')
```

## Download Required Model

```bash
cd ai_processing/whisper.cpp/models
wget https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-medium.en.bin
```

## Quality Improvements Expected

- **Better accuracy** for technical terms and proper names
- **Improved punctuation** and sentence structure  
- **Better handling** of accents and speaking styles
- **Reduced hallucinations** in quiet segments

## Performance Impact

- **Processing time**: ~2x slower than base
- **Memory usage**: ~20x larger model file
- **Quality gain**: Significant improvement for meeting transcription

## Alternative: Environment Override

Keep flexibility by setting environment variable:
```bash
# For best quality (if you have resources)
export WHISPER_MODEL_PATH="./whisper.cpp/models/ggml-large-v3.bin"

# For balanced performance
export WHISPER_MODEL_PATH="./whisper.cpp/models/ggml-medium.en.bin"

# For speed (current)
export WHISPER_MODEL_PATH="./whisper.cpp/models/ggml-base.en.bin"
```

The medium model provides the best balance of quality and performance for meeting transcription.
