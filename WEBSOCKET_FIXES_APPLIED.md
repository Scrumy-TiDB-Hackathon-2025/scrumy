# WebSocket Connection Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified from Logs

### 1. **SESSION_REGISTERED Message Spam**
- **Problem**: Server was sending hundreds of `SESSION_REGISTERED` messages
- **Root Cause**: Session registration was being called on every audio chunk
- **Fix Applied**: Added check to only register session once per WebSocket connection

### 2. **Excessive WebSocket Reconnections**
- **Problem**: WebSocket was disconnecting and reconnecting frequently
- **Root Cause**: Poor connection state management and unnecessary reconnection attempts
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Improved connection state checking in `initializeWebSocket()`
  - Added check for normal closure (code 1000) to prevent unnecessary reconnections
  - Prevent multiple connection attempts when already connecting

### 3. **Connection State Management**
- **Problem**: Messages being sent on closed connections
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient connection state validation
- **Fix Applied**: Enhanced connection state checking before sending messages

## Code Changes Made

### Server-side (`websocket_server.py`)

```python
# Fix 1: Prevent session registration spam
if websocket not in self.websocket_to_session:
    await self._handle_session_registration(websocket, message, participants)
```

### Client-side (`content.js`)

```javascript
// Fix 2: Prevent duplicate WebSocket initialization
if (websocket && (websocket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN || websocket.readyState === WebSocket.CONNECTING)) {
    console.log("ðŸ”Œ WebSocket already connected or connecting, skipping...");
    return;
}

// Fix 3: Improved reconnection logic
websocket.onclose = (event) => {
    console.log("ðŸ”Œ WebSocket disconnected", event.code, event.reason);
    // Only reconnect if not shutting down and not a normal closure
    if (!isShuttingDown && event.code !== 1000) {
        console.log("ðŸ”„ Reconnecting WebSocket in 3 seconds...");
        setTimeout(initializeWebSocket, 3000);
    } else {
        console.log("ðŸš« Skipping reconnect - normal closure or recording stopped");
    }
};

// Fix 4: Better connection state checking
if (!websocket || websocket.readyState !== WebSocket.OPEN) {
    console.log(`[Content] WebSocket not connected (state: ${websocket?.readyState})`);
    
    // Don't initialize if already connecting
    if (!websocket || websocket.readyState === WebSocket.CLOSED) {
        initializeWebSocket();
    }
}
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. **Reduced Message Spam**: No more hundreds of `SESSION_REGISTERED` messages
2. **Stable Connections**: WebSocket should maintain connection without frequent reconnects
3. **Better Error Handling**: Proper handling of connection states and closure codes
4. **Improved Performance**: Less network overhead and CPU usage

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Monitor WebSocket Messages**: Check that `SESSION_REGISTERED` appears only once per session
2. **Connection Stability**: Verify WebSocket stays connected during recording
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensure proper cleanup when stopping recording
4. **Audio Processing**: Confirm audio chunks are still processed correctly

## Additional Monitoring

The fixes maintain all existing functionality while improving stability:
- Audio processing continues to work
- Transcription results are still delivered
- Meeting end signals are properly handled
- Buffer flushing works as expected

These changes should resolve the connection issues seen in the logs while maintaining the robust audio processing capabilities of ScrumBot.
