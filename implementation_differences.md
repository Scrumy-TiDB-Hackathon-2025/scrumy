# Implementation Differences: Meetily vs. Scrumy

## Overview

This document provides a detailed technical analysis of the differences between the original Meetily implementation and our Scrumy implementation, particularly focusing on the audio transcription functionality that currently works in Meetily but fails in Scrumy.

## Core Architectural Differences

| Component | Meetily Implementation | Scrumy Implementation | Impact |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Directory Structure** | Clear separation: `meeting-minutes/backend` and `meeting-minutes/frontend` | Different structure with `scrumy/ai_processing` | Path references broken |
| **Working Directory** | Assumes execution from `meeting-minutes/backend` | Mixed assumptions about working directory | Runtime errors finding resources |
| **Whisper Integration** | Direct integration with local compiled binary | Same approach but with path mismatches | Transcription fails due to missing components |
| **Build Process** | Unified build script that handles all dependencies | Similar scripts but with incorrect paths | Incomplete dependency installation |

## Critical Path Differences

### Executable Path

**Meetily:**
```python
whisper_executable = "./whisper-server-package/whisper-server"
```

**Scrumy:**
```python
whisper_executable = "./whisper-server-package/main"
```

**Issue:** The executable is named `whisper-server` in reality, but our code is looking for `main`.

### Model Path

**Meetily:**
```python
model_path = './whisper-server-package/models/ggml-medium.bin'
# OR uses a symbolic link from ggml-medium.bin to for-tests-ggml-base.en.bin
```

**Scrumy:**
```python
model_path = './whisper-server-package/models/for-tests-ggml-base.en.bin'
```

**Issue:** The model file is actually named `ggml-medium.bin`, but our code is looking for `for-tests-ggml-base.en.bin` without a symbolic link between them.

### Working Directory Assumptions

**Meetily:**
- Assumes all relative paths are from `meeting-minutes/backend/`
- Scripts and code aligned with this assumption

**Scrumy:**
- Mixed assumptions about working directory
- Some code assumes running from `scrumy/ai_processing/`
- Some scripts assume running from project root

## Build Process Differences

### Meetily Build Process

1. `build_whisper.sh` properly:
   - Updates git submodules
   - Builds Whisper.cpp from source
   - Downloads the requested model
   - Creates package with correct structure
   - Sets permissions appropriately

2. `clean_start_backend.sh` correctly:
   - Verifies required components exist
   - Starts Whisper server on port 8178
   - Starts Python API on port 5167
   - Creates proper environment

### Scrumy Build Process

The build process attempts to follow the same steps but encounters issues:

1. Directory path problems:
   ```
   cd: no such file or directory: meeting-minutes/backend
   ```

2. Missing symbolic links:
   - No link from `whisper-server` to `main`
   - No link from `ggml-medium.bin` to `for-tests-ggml-base.en.bin`

3. Port configuration issues in server startup:
   ```
   echo -e "${BLUE}Whisper Server Port: $PORT${NC}"
   echo -e "${BLUE}Python Backend Port: 8178${NC}"
   ```
   The ports appear to be reversed or incorrectly referenced.

## API Implementation Differences

### Transcription Endpoint

**Meetily:**
```python
@app.post("/transcribe")
async def transcribe(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    # Correct paths that match actual filesystem
    whisper_executable = "./whisper-server-package/whisper-server"
    model_path = './whisper-server-package/models/ggml-medium.bin'
    
    # Rest of implementation...
```

**Scrumy:**
```python
@app.post("/transcribe")
async def transcribe(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    # Incorrect paths that don't match filesystem
    whisper_executable = "./whisper-server-package/main"
    model_path = './whisper-server-package/models/for-tests-ggml-base.en.bin'
    
    # Rest of implementation...
```

The core logic is nearly identical, but the path references don't match reality in the Scrumy implementation.

## Frontend Integration Differences

The frontend integration approach is similar between both implementations, but subtle differences in event handling and state management exist:

- **Meetily:** Consistent state management between frontend and backend recording state
- **Scrumy:** Some inconsistencies in synchronizing recording state, though this isn't the primary issue

## Root Causes of Transcription Failure

1. **Missing Executable:** The transcription fails immediately because it can't find the Whisper executable at the expected path

2. **Missing Model File:** Even if the executable were found, it would fail to find the model file due to name mismatch

3. **Working Directory Issues:** The relative paths don't resolve correctly due to different working directory assumptions

4. **Build Process Incompleteness:** The build process doesn't complete successfully, leaving required components missing

## Solution Strategy

To fix the transcription functionality, we need to address these specific issues:

1. **Create Required Symbolic Links:**
   ```bash
   # In meeting-minutes/backend/whisper-server-package/
   ln -sf whisper-server main
   
   # In meeting-minutes/backend/whisper-server-package/models/
   ln -sf ggml-medium.bin for-tests-ggml-base.en.bin
   ```

2. **Fix Path References:**
   Update `scrumy/ai_processing/app/main.py` to use correct absolute paths:
   ```python
   whisper_executable = "../meeting-minutes/backend/whisper-server-package/whisper-server"
   model_path = '../meeting-minutes/backend/whisper-server-package/models/ggml-medium.bin'
   ```

3. **Update Working Directory Settings:**
   Ensure all scripts run from the correct working directory, or use absolute paths throughout

4. **Fix Build and Startup Scripts:**
   Correct path references in all build and startup scripts to match our actual project structure

## Long-Term Recommendations

1. **Unified Configuration:**
   Create a central configuration system for paths and settings

2. **Containerization:**
   Consider containerizing the Whisper service for better portability

3. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   Add tests specifically for verifying the transcription functionality

4. **Path Abstraction:**
   Implement a path resolution system that can adapt to different environments

## Conclusion

The audio transcription issue is primarily due to path and filename mismatches between what our code expects and what actually exists in the filesystem. The underlying architecture is sound, but these specific implementation details need to be aligned for the system to work properly.

By addressing these specific issues, we can make the transcription functionality work in our Scrumy implementation just as it does in the original Meetily project.
