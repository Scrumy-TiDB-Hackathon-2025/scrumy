## Overview

An AI-powered meeting assistant that captures live meeting audio, transcribes it in real-time, and generates summaries while ensuring user privacy. Perfect for teams who want to focus on discussions while automatically capturing and organizing meeting content.

### Why?

While there are many meeting transcription tools available, this solution stands out by offering:
- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally on your device
- **Cost Effective**: Uses open-source AI models instead of expensive APIs
- **Flexible**: Works offline, supports multiple meeting platforms
- **Customizable**: Self-host and modify for your specific needs
- **Intelligent**: Built-in knowledge graph for semantic search across meetings

## Features

âœ… Modern, responsive UI with real-time updates

âœ… Real-time audio capture (microphone + system audio)

âœ… Live transcription using Whisper.cpp

ðŸš§ Speaker diarization

âœ… Local processing for privacy

âœ… Packaged the app for macOS and Windows

ðŸš§ Export to Markdown/PDF


> **Note**: We have a Rust-based implementation that explores better performance and native integration. It currently implements:
> - âœ… Real-time audio capture from both microphone and system audio
> - âœ… Live transcription using locally-running Whisper
> - âœ… Speaker diarization
> - âœ… Rich text editor for notes
> 
We are currently working on:
> - âœ… Export to Markdown/PDF
> - âœ… Export to HTML


## Release 0.0.3

A new release is available!

Please check out the release [here](https://github.com/Zackriya-Solutions/meeting-minutes/releases/tag/v0.0.3).

### What's New
- **Windows Support**: Fixed audio capture issues on Windows
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error handling and logging for audio devices
- **Enhanced Device Detection**: More robust audio device detection across platforms
- **Windows Installers**: Added both .exe and .msi installers for Windows
- Transcription quality is improved
- Bug fixes and improvements for frontend
- Better backend app build process
- Improved documentation

### What would be next?
- Database connection to save meeting minutes
- Improve summarization quality for smaller LLM models
- Add download options for meeting transcriptions 
- Add download option for summary

### Known issues
- Smaller LLMs can hallucinate, making summarization quality poor; Please use model above 32B parameter size
- Backend build process requires CMake, C++ compiler, etc. Making it harder to build
- Backend build process requires Python 3.10 or newer
- Frontend build process requires Node.js

## LLM Integration

The backend supports multiple LLM providers through a unified interface. Current implementations include:

### Supported Providers
- **Anthropic** (Claude models)
- **Groq** (Llama3.2 90 B)
- **Ollama** (Local models that supports function calling)

### Configuration
Create `.env` file with your API keys:
```env
# Required for Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here  

# Required for Groq 
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here

```

## System Architecture

![High Level Architecture](docs/HighLevel.jpg)

### Core Components

1. **Audio Capture Service**
   - Real-time microphone/system audio capture
   - Audio preprocessing pipeline
   - Built with Rust (experimental) and Python

2. **Transcription Engine**
   - Whisper.cpp for local transcription
   - Supports multiple model sizes (tiny->large)
   - GPU-accelerated processing

3. **LLM Orchestrator**
   - Unified interface for multiple providers
   - Automatic fallback handling
   - Chunk processing with overlap
   - Model configuration:

4. **Data Services**
   - **ChromaDB**: Vector store for transcript embeddings
   - **SQLite**: Process tracking and metadata storage

5. **API Layer**
   - FastAPI endpoints:
     - POST /upload
     - POST /process
     - GET /summary/{id}
     - DELETE /summary/{id}

### Deployment Architecture

- **Frontend**: Tauri app + Next.js (packaged executables)
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI:
  - Transcript workers
  - LLM inference

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- FFmpeg
- Rust 1.65+ (for experimental features)
- Cmake 3.22+ (for building the frontend)
- For Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ development workload

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Frontend Setup

#### Run packaged version

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Zackriya-Solutions/meeting-minutes/releases) and download the latest version.

**For Windows:**
- Download either the `.exe` installer or `.msi` package
- Once the installer is downloaded, double-click the executable file to run it
- Windows will ask if you want to run untrusted apps, click "More info" and choose "Run anyway"
- Follow the installation wizard to complete the setup
- The application will be installed and available on your desktop

**For macOS:**
- Download the `dmg_darwin_arch64.zip` file
- Extract the file
- Double-click the `.dmg` file inside the extracted folder
- Drag the application to your Applications folder
- Execute the following command in terminal to remove the quarantine attribute:
  ```
  xattr -c /Applications/meeting-minutes-frontend.app
  ```

Provide necessary permissions for audio capture and microphone access.

#### Dev run

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Give execute permissions to clean_build.sh
chmod +x clean_build.sh

# run clean_build.sh
./clean_build.sh
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zackriya-Solutions/meeting-minutes.git
cd meeting-minutes/backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add environment file with API keys
# On macOS/Linux:
echo -e "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key\nGROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key" | tee .env

# On Windows (PowerShell):
"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key`nGROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key" | Out-File -FilePath .env -Encoding utf8

# Configure environment variables for Groq
# On macOS/Linux:
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

# On Windows (PowerShell):
$env:GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"

# Build dependencies
# On macOS/Linux:
chmod +x build_whisper.sh
./build_whisper.sh

# On Windows:
.\build_whisper.bat

# Start backend servers
# On macOS/Linux:
./clean_start_backend.sh

# On Windows:
.\start_with_output.ps1
```

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the established project structure
- Write tests for new features
- Document API changes
- Use type hints in Python code
- Follow ESLint configuration for JavaScript/TypeScript

## Introducing Subscription

We are planning to add a subscription option so that you don't have to run the backend on your own server. This will help you scale better and run the service 24/7. This is based on a few requests we received. If you are interested, please fill out the form [here](http://zackriya.com/aimeeting/).
