# Meeting Minutes - AI-Powered Meeting Assistant

An AI-powered meeting assistant that captures live meeting audio, transcribes it in real-time, and generates summaries while ensuring user privacy. Perfect for teams who want to focus on discussions while automatically capturing and organizing meeting content.

## Why?

While there are many meeting transcription tools available, this solution stands out by offering:
- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally on your device
- **Cost Effective**: Uses open-source AI models instead of expensive APIs
- **Flexible**: Works offline, supports multiple meeting platforms
- **Customizable**: Self-host and modify for your specific needs
- **Intelligent**: Built-in knowledge graph for semantic search across meetings

> **Note**: We have an experimental Rust-based implementation that explores better performance and native integration. It currently implements:
> - âœ… Real-time audio capture from both microphone and system audio
> - âœ… Live transcription using locally-running Whisper
> - âœ… Speaker diarization
> - âœ… Rich text editor for notes
> 
> See [Rust Implementation](experiment/rust_based_implementation) for details.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- Python >= 3.9
- Virtual audio driver:
  - macOS: BlackHole (recommended)
  - Windows: Virtual Audio Cable
  - Linux: PulseAudio

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Frontend Setup

```bash

# Clone the screenpipe repository
git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe.git

# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Give execute permissions to clean_build.sh
chmod +x clean_build.sh

# run clean_build.sh
./clean_build.sh
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start backend server
cd app
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. Audio Setup

1. Install the virtual audio driver for your OS
2. Configure system audio to route through the virtual device
3. Verify audio routing in the application settings
