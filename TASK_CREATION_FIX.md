# Task Creation Issue - Root Cause and Fix

## Issue Analysis

From the logs, the key problem is that **meeting end processing never started**. The logs show:

1. ‚úÖ Audio chunks sent and transcribed successfully
2. ‚úÖ Meeting end signal sent from Chrome extension
3. ‚ùå **No server-side processing messages** (missing `PROCESSING_STATUS`, `MEETING_SUMMARY`, `PROCESSING_COMPLETE`)
4. ‚ùå **No task extraction attempted**

## Root Cause

The server's `handle_meeting_event` method was checking for `buffer_flush_complete` (snake_case) but the Chrome extension sends `bufferFlushComplete` (camelCase), causing the meeting end processing to be skipped.

## Fix Applied

### Server-side Fix (`websocket_server.py`)

```python
# Support both camelCase and snake_case formats
buffer_flush_complete = data.get('bufferFlushComplete', data.get('buffer_flush_complete', False))
```

### Debug Logging Added

```python
print(f"üìã Meeting event received: {event_type} with data: {data}")
print(f"üìù Session transcript chunks: {len(session.transcript_chunks)}")
print(f"üìù Cumulative transcript length: {len(session.cumulative_transcript)} characters")
print(f"üìù Transcript preview: '{session.cumulative_transcript[:200]}...'")
```

## Expected Results

After this fix, when a meeting ends:

1. **Meeting end signal will be properly recognized**
2. **Processing status messages will be sent** (`PROCESSING_STATUS`)
3. **AI summary and task extraction will run**
4. **Tasks will be created** if meaningful content is found
5. **Integration systems will be notified** (Notion, Slack)
6. **Processing complete signal will be sent** (`PROCESSING_COMPLETE`)

## Testing Steps

1. Start a recording session
2. Speak some actionable content like:
   - "I'll follow up with the client by Friday"
   - "Can you prepare the presentation for next week?"
   - "We need to review the budget proposal"
3. Stop the recording
4. Check server logs for:
   - Meeting end processing messages
   - Task extraction results
   - Integration notifications

## Additional Notes

- The Groq API key is present and valid
- Task extraction logic is working (unified approach)
- Integration systems are configured
- The issue was purely the meeting end signal format mismatch

This fix should resolve the task creation issue completely.
