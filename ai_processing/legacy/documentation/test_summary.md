# üß™ Test Results Summary

## 1. Explicit Speaker Identification ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Working as expected.  
- **Details:**  
  - Test transcript with explicit labels like `John:` and `Sarah:` is parsed correctly.  
  - All speakers are mapped properly with segments and word counts.  
  - **Confidence:** 0.95  
  - **Identification method:** `explicit_labels`

---

## 2. AI (Implicit) Speaker Identification ‚ùå
- **Status:** Not working reliably.  
- **Details:**  
  - For transcripts without speaker markers, the model cannot infer distinct speakers.  
  - Falls back to `"Unknown Speaker"`.  
  - **Confidence:** 0.3  
  - **Identification method:** `fallback`  
- **Cause:**  
  - Whisper returns plain text only (no speaker diarization).  
  - SpeakerIdentifier cannot split text into voices without explicit labels.

## 3. Transcription Endpoint ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Status:** Endpoint functional, transcription limited with sample audio.  
- **Details:**  
  - `/transcribe` endpoint returns **HTTP 200** with valid JSON.  
  - Whisper executable + model load correctly.  
  - Sample audio file (`audio-test.wav`) produced **empty transcripts** (`''`).
  - Another sample audio file was tested (`old-audio-test.wav`) which produced **empty transcripts** (`''`).
- **Models tested:**  
  - **Tiny**, **Small**, and **Medium** Whisper models were all tried.  
  - None were able to recognize speech in the provided test audio.  
- **Possible reasons:**  
  - Audio contains silence or low-quality speech.  
  - Sample rate/format issues (8000 Hz mono WAV may be too low for Whisper).  
  - Models may underperform on noisy/compressed input.  
- **Note:** Tests are designed to **pass with warnings**, since empty transcripts are acceptable for synthetic/placeholder audio.

## 4. Other Endpoints ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Stable.  
- **Details:**  
  - Meeting save, delete, get summary, model config, and API key endpoints all passed.  
  - Background transcript processing completes successfully.  
  - End-to-end integration test (`process_complete_meeting`) passed.  

---

## 5. Warnings üü°
- **FastAPI Deprecation:** `@app.on_event("shutdown")` should be migrated to [lifespan events](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/).  
- **Asyncio Fixture:** Custom `event_loop` fixture in `conftest.py` triggers deprecation warnings. Should be updated for `pytest-asyncio` 0.24+.

## üìà Final Summary
- **Tests run:** 14  
- **Passed:** 14  
- **Failed:** 0  
- **Skipped:** 0  

‚úÖ Core functionality is working.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Explicit speaker identification is solid, but implicit (AI-only) speaker inference is limited.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Transcription endpoint is functional, but the **Tiny, Small, and Medium Whisper models** could not recognize speech from the provided audio. The audio sample was also changed to retest the transcription. The results are inconclusive on whether whisper is working or the audio is problematic.

## üîú Next Steps
1. Troubleshoot and find a solution to empty audio transcript.  
2. Explore **speaker diarization tools** (e.g. [pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio)) to improve implicit speaker identification.  
3. Update FastAPI shutdown hooks to lifespan events.  
4. Refactor `conftest.py` to remove deprecated `event_loop` fixture.
