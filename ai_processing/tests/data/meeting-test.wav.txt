 This is a sprint planning meeting for January 30, 2025.
 Sarah is speaking as product manager.
 All right, team.
 Let's review our sprint goals.
 We need to focus on the user authentication system this week.
 John as developer.
 I can take the user documentation of this.
 We need to make sure the API docs are current before release.
 I'll get that done by Wednesday.
 Mike as DevOps.
 I'll handle the staging deployment.
 We should get the environment ready by Thursday,
 so QA has time to test everything properly.
 Lisa as QA engineer.
 Speaking of testing,
 I need to run the comprehensive test suits once staging is deployed.
 It's crucial for our Friday release.
 Sarah, great assignments, everyone.
 John, can you investigate those database performance issues
 we've been seeing in production?
 John, absolutely.
 I'll look into optimizing database indexes as well.
 That should help with the slow queries.
 Mike, I should follow up on the staging deployment
 to make sure everything is running smoothly after the initial setup.
 Sarah, perfect.
 Let's also make sure that someone with researches
 the database performance issues more thoroughly in our next sprints.
 This concludes our sprint planning meeting.
 Thank you, everyone.
