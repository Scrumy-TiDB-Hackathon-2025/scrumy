## 🖥️ Mock Servers Status

### Frontend Dashboard REST API ✅ FULLY WORKING
```bash
cd shared/mock-servers/frontend-dashboard
./start-server.sh
# Available at: http://localhost:3001
```
- ✅ All endpoints operational
- ✅ Realistic static data
- ✅ CORS configured
- ✅ Ready for frontend development

### Chrome Extension WebSocket ⚠️ MOSTLY WORKING
```bash
cd shared/mock-servers/chrome-extension
./start-server.sh
# Available at: ws://localhost:8000/ws/audio
```
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ⚠️ Minor connection stability issues
- ✅ Non-critical for development
